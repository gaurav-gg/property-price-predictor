The city, a major information technology hub, has wide roads and a lot of greenery. Bengaluru&rsquo;s pleasant climate invites immigrants in great numbers. A large of MNCs and immigrants drive the city&rsquo;s rental market in a big way. The city has sound infrastructure and good growth prospects. So, the city also enjoys great popularity among investors. Over the past decade, Bengaluru&rsquo;s real estate prices have been increasing.</p>\n<strong>History</strong>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">At different phases in history, the city was ruled by various South Indian Dynasties, the Marathas, the Mughals, Maharaja of Mysore and the British. The Western Ganga Dynasty ruled the city between the 4th and 10th centuries. Bengaluru, which became Mysore&rsquo;s capital, was later made Karnataka&rsquo;s capital city in the year 1956.</p>\n<strong>Geography</strong>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Equidistant from eastern and western coast of the South Indian peninsula, Bengaluru is situated at 12&deg; 59&rsquo; north latitude and 77&deg; 57&rsquo; east longitude. It is located 920 m above sea level. In a year, the city has 60 rainy days. Over the past decade, the annual rainfall has been around 880 mm. In summers, the temperature varies from 18 degrees celsius to 38 degrees celsius. On the other hand, in winters, the temperature varies from 12 degrees celsius to 25 degrees clesius. Bengaluru enjoys a pleasant climate all the year around.</p>\n<strong>Governance and Civil Administration</strong>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) is responsible for civic administration. BBMP came into existence in 2007, with 250 members forming the part of the city council. The main expenditure of BBMP is incurred on public health, engineering, welfare and road-related infrastructure. BBMP is responsible for maintenance and administration of various infrastructure projects.</p>\n<strong>Economy, Industry and Employment</strong>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Bengaluru is a favourite city among various multinational companies. The city is an IT Hub of the country. It has offices of 682 multi-national corporations (MNCs), 131 biotech companies, 1,685 IT and IT-enabled service companies. Some of the government organization that have set up their headquarters in the city are BEL, HAL, NAL, ISRO, BEML and HMT. The city offers ample number of educational opportunities to the residents attracting more students to the city. This further brings growth in the city&rsquo;s rental market.</p>\n<strong>Infrastructure</strong>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Bengaluru has a sound infrastructure providing comfort and convenience to the city. In terms of passenger traffic, Bengaluru&rsquo;s Kempegowda International Airport is the third-busiest airport in India. The city has a rapid transit system and four main railway stations providing good public transportation facilities to the residents. Buses by Bengaluru Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) are another means of transportation. The sound infrastructure and good growth prospects attract many developers and investors. An outer ring road links Hebbal, Yeshwanthpur, Marathahalli and Sarjapur. It is expected that a 288 km satellite town ring road will link the satellite towns of the city. Other proposed project includes a 41-km mono rail project that operates from JP Nagar to Hebbal. There is a 33-km high speed rail link connecting the central business district of the city with the international airport.</p>\n<strong>Real Estate in Bengaluru</strong>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The setting up of IT companies in Bengaluru has increased the number of people moving to the city, leading to an increased demand for property. The demand increased in the north of Bengaluru when the international airport was set up there. Elevated expressway and rapid commercial development are some of the factors responsible for creating a positive impact on the city&rsquo;s rental market. The setting up of electronic city pushed the real estate prices in the South of Bengaluru. In Bengaluru, rental housing plays a great role.</p>","isServing":true,"isServingResale":true,"avgPricePerUnitArea":5037.767,"avgPricePerUnitAreaApartment":5037.767,"avgPricePerUnitAreaPlot":1590.5151,"avgPricePerUnitAreaVilla":5994.7605,"avgPriceRisePercentage":23.4,"avgPriceRisePercentageApartment":23.4,"avgPriceRisePercentagePlot":23.4,"avgPriceRisePercentageVilla":11.1,"avgPriceRiseMonths":62,"minZoomLevel":11,"maxZoomLevel":14,"projectCount":9068,"dominantUnitType":"Apartment","avgBHKPricePerUnitArea":{"1":2957.94,"2":3250.431,"3":4092.037,"4":6634.0},"amenities":[{"id":83482,"cityId":2,"localityId":0,"placeTypeId":13,"name":"Kempegowda
